# T250 – World's Fastest Open-Source 3D Printer

The **T250** is a next-generation, high-performance 3D printer built from the ground up for speed, reliability, and print quality.  
With verified real-world acceleration of up to **250,000 mm/s²** and sustained print speeds exceeding **1,000 mm/s**, the T250 sets a new benchmark in open-source high-speed 3D printing.

> ⚠️ This is not your average printer project. The T250 is designed for experienced builders and performance enthusiasts.

---

- Prints a **Speedboat in under 2 minutes**  
- Produces **high-quality parts 4× faster** compared to a Bambu Printer
- Currently ranks **#1 on the world’s fastest printer [leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lFiJi-X3Xm3hh3I9Ty9dfACMiBWxHFAOUeiU1km9m6I)**
- And the best part: It’s **100% open-source**.  
  All resources needed to build your own T250 are available in this repository.

## Print Settings

To print the STL files, a 3D printer with a print bed of at least 350x350mm is required. I've printed most parts out of PLA. It's recommended to print the Carriage out of Nylon/ASA.
For all STL Parts i've used the following settings:

- 0.25 Layer height
- 0.5 Line width
- 5 Top layers
- 5 Bottom layers
- 5 Walls
- 25% Infill
- Grid infill for the Frame parts and Gyroid for the Gantry & Toolhead parts
