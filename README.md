# T250 – World's Fastest Open-Source 3D Printer

The **T250** is a next-generation, high-performance 3D printer built from the ground up for speed, reliability, and print quality.  
With verified real-world acceleration of up to **250,000 mm/s²** and sustained print speeds exceeding **1,000 mm/s**, the T250 sets a new benchmark in open-source high-speed 3D printing.

> ⚠️ This is not your average printer project. The T250 is designed for experienced builders and performance enthusiasts.

---

- Prints a **Speedboat in under 2 minutes**  
- Produces **high-quality parts 4× faster** compared to a Bambu Printer
- Currently ranks **#1 on the world’s fastest printer leaderboard**
- And the best part: It’s **100% open-source**.  
  All resources needed to build your own T250 are available in this repository.
